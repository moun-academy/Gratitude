# Gratitude Design System

This repository contains a lightweight, neutral-forward design language with gradients, standardized micro-animated components, and a warm icon set.

## Getting started
Open `index.html` in your browser to explore tokens, components, and icons. Everything is defined with CSS custom properties to make them easy to consume in other projects.

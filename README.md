# Gratitude

A lightweight, presence-first journaling flow you can run locally. Open `index.html` in your browser to practice a daily set of 5–10 gratitude prompts with streak-aware nudges.

## Features
- Onboarding that explains the intent (gratitude and presence) plus a sample prompt.
- Home view with today’s CTA, progress indicator, last score summary, and gentle reminders.
- Simple session modal for answering 5–10 questions, capturing a presence score, and tracking streaks.

## Getting started
Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Your streaks, progress, and last scores are stored in `localStorage` so you can close and return without losing context.

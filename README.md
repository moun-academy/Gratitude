# Gratitude

A lightweight React Native / Expo prototype with configurable gratitude reminder notifications.

## Features
- Schedule local notifications with daily or weekly cadence and quiet hours to avoid night-time pings.
- Rotate through gentle, grounded reminder copy to reduce repetition.
- In-app reminder settings screen with toggles, cadence controls, quiet-hour fields, preview text, and a "snooze for today" control.

## Development
1. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn`).
2. Run the app: `npm start` and open in Expo Go.
3. Adjust reminder settings in the app; scheduling uses Expo Notifications.
